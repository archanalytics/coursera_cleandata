Coursera Project for Getting and Cleaning Data - David Twaddell
---------------------------------------------------------------

The project is to read the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set, merge the training and activity datasets to produce a new tidy dataset, and use this to calculate the average mean and standard deviation variables. The output is saved to a tidy data set.

Here are the steps involved to run:

Run the run\_analysis.R. The input data is automatically retrieved by the run\_analysis.R script. When the script completes, check no errors on the console, and that the output tidydata.txt is created in the working folder.

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the associated code book.
