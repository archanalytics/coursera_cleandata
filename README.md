progamming assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The objective is to demonstrate effective data handling
The script creates a folder called data under the working directory, if it doesn't already exist.
Then downloads,  unzips and reads in the data for the exercise
The train and test datasets are merged and the mean and SD observations extracted into a subset dataset
the Activity attribute values are provided readable names from a file of values
Other attribute names are provided clearer names
Once this is complete a summary dataset is created with  aggregate values and saved to "tidydata.txt" in the working directory
